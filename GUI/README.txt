How to use:

Launch gui.py by whatever means you wish.

The title screen will be the first screen to appear.
Once you leave this screen, it cannot be returned to without
re-launching the GUI.

Press C for table of contents (display of keys for different slides)

DO NOT PROCEED THROUGH A SLIDE BEFORE IT HAS FINISHED DRAWING.

Doing so will cause multiple methods in the GUI's code to run at once,
which will graphical glitches as the turtle attempts to be in two places 
at the same time. Wait for slides to finish drawing.
