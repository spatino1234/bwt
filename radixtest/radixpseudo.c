instantiate an array of linked lists
for string pointer in input strings
    get a pointer to that string
    append that pointer to the correct linked list
for linked list in array
    sort the linkedlist using some sort of nlogn, dereferencing each pointer as the comparator
LinkedList lsort(LinkedList input) {
    return output;
}
