🧬 **The World of DNA and BWT** 
- Human DNA, a vast universe of over 3 billion characters (A, C, G, T), poses complex challenges in genome sequencing. Our project tackles these challenges head-on, exploring efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to a reference genome – a crucial task given the sheer volume and potential imperfections in the data.

**Why BWT?** 🤔
- A Compression Powerhouse: BWT isn't just a compressive technique; it's a marvel in data storage and handling, especially for repetitive sequences like human DNA.
- Versatility: From file compression (think bzip2) to DNA, BWT's adaptability is nothing short of amazing.

🌟 **The Project Mission**
- Decode the BWT and FM-Index: Understand the why and how behind these compression superheroes.
- Reference Genome Realities: Delve into the creation and ethical considerations of reference genomes.
- Aligners in Action: Run and analyze outputs from existing BWT-based aligners, comparing their efficacy.
- Hands-On Implementation: We're not just studying; we're building! From exact matches to handling mismatches and gaps, we're on it.
- Data Playground: Engaging with real and simulated datasets to test and refine our alignment algorithms.
